This folder contains a dotfile called .envrc with the instructions to initialize a Python Virtual Environment everytime you enter the folder. To use you need to install [direnv](https://github.com/direnv/direnv)

You should include a `requirements.txt` file with the list of libraries used by your scripts. Then, to install the libraries just run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
